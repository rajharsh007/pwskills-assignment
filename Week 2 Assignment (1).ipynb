    "Ans: In Python, you can comment your code to add explanatory notes or to disable specific lines of code temporarily. There are two common ways to add comments in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single-line comments: To add a comment that spans only one line, you can use the hash character (`#`). Anything after the `#` symbol on the same line will be considered a comment and will be ignored by the Python interpreter. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "            # This is a single-line comment\n",
    "        print(\"Hello, world!\")  # This is another comment\n",
    "                                                                                                    \n",
    "2. Multi-line comments: To add comments that span multiple lines, you can enclose the text within triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`). While these are technically string literals, they are commonly used as multi-line comments because they are not assigned to any variable and are effectively ignored. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "              This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    "              It can span multiple lines.\n",

    "Ans: In Python, you can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or by using the constructor functions of the target data type. Here are some commonly used type conversion functions and constructor functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `int()`: Converts a value to an integer (whole number) data type. \n",
    "            For example:\n",
    "            \n",
    "                    x = int(3.14)  # x will be 3\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `float()`: Converts a value to a floating-point (decimal) data type.\n",
    "              For example: \n",
    "              \n",
    "                      x = float(5)  # x will be 5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `str()`: Converts a value to a string data type. \n",
    "            For example:\n",
    "            \n",
    "                    x = str(10)  # x will be the string '10'.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `bool()`: Converts a value to a boolean (True/False) data type.\n",
    "             For example:\n",
    "             \n",
    "                     x = bool(1)  # x will be True\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `list()`: Converts an iterable (such as a string, tuple, or range) to a list data type. \n",
    "             For example:-\n",
    "             \n",
    "                     x = list(\"Hello\")  # x will be the list ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `tuple()`: Converts an iterable to a tuple data type. \n",
    "              For example:\n",
    "              \n",
    "                      x = tuple([1, 2, 3])  # x will be the tuple (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `set()`: Converts an iterable to a set data type, removing duplicate elements. \n",
    "            For example:\n",
    "            \n",
    "                    x = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])  # x will be the set {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `dict()`: Converts an iterable of key-value pairs to a dictionary data type. \n",
    "             For example:\n",
    "             \n",
    "                      x = dict([('a', 1), ('b', 2)])  # x will be the dictionary {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    " \n",
    "It's important to note that not all type conversions are possible or meaningful. For example, converting a string to an integer would work if the string represents a valid integer, but it would raise an error if the string contains non-numeric characters. Similarly, converting a string to a boolean would result in `True` only if the string is `\"True\"` (case-insensitive), and it would be `False` for any other string value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing a type conversion, it's a good practice to ensure that the value is compatible with the desired data type to avoid potential errors."

    "       cd Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you're in the correct directory, you can run the Python script by typing `python` followed by the script's filename:\n",
    "\n",
    "       python script.py \n",
    "   \n",
    "   This command executes the Python interpreter and tells it to run the specified script. In this case, it will execute the `script.py` file, and you should see the output `\"Hello, world!\"` displayed on the command line."
